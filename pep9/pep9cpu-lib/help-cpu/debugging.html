The Pep/9 CPU system provides debugging tools to help you locate errors in the microcode you write.
The tools include the ability to trace your program by single stepping through it and the ability to set break points.
An additional debugging tool is the byte converter, which is available any time the application is running.

<h3><a name="Tracing">Tracing microcode</a></h3>

To use the debugger first enter a microcode program in the Microcode pane.
For example, here is the microprogram for Figure 12.5 from the textbook.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/debugger1.png" alt="debugger1" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
<h4>Starting the debugger</h4>
Then select
Debug&rarr;Start Debugging from the menu or click the corresponding Start Debugging icon on the toolbar.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/startdebuggingmenu.png" alt="startdebuggingmenu" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/startdebuggingicon.png" alt="startdebuggingicon" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
Pep/9 CPU will assemble your microprogram and, if there are no errors, will then put the application in debugging mode.
If there is an assembler error the message will be displayed as described in the section Microcode Use and
the application will not be in debugging mode.
You can correct your assembler errors using the techniques explained in that section.
<p>
<h4>Using the debugger</h4>
When you are in debugging mode, the two buttons Clock and Copy to Microcode are disabled and you
can single step through your program.
<p>
The following scenario shows the process of debugging Figure 12.5.
When you enter the debugger, the first statement that is <i>about to be</i> executed is highlighted
in the Source Code pane.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/debugger2.png" alt="debugger2" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
The values from the unit test preconditions are displayed in the CPU pane.
In the figure, the program counter (PC) is set to 0x00FF and the shadow carry bit S is set to 0.
The byte at memory address 0xFF is set to 0xAB, which is not shown in the figure.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/debugger4.png" alt="debugger4" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
In the above figure, the control widgets also correspond to the statement that is about to execute.
In particular, A is set to 6, which puts the most significant byte of PC on the ABus,
B is set to 7, which puts the least significant byte of PC on the BBus,
and MARCk is checked, which will clock those values into the memory address register MARA and MARB.
<p>
Corresponding to the Microcode pane, the Object Code pane shows the binary object code for the statement that
will execute next.
It displays decimal values for the binary fields.
For example, the A field is a five-bit field with value 00110, which the Object Code pane shows as 6.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/debugger3.png" alt="debugger3" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
<h4>Single stepping</h4>
To trace what happens when the instruction executes select Debug&rarr;Single Step from the menu
or click the corresponding icon in the tool bar.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/singlestepmenu.png" alt="singlestepmenu" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/singlestepicon.png" alt="singlestepicon" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
The highlighted line in the Microcode pane and the Object Code pane is now the statement <i>that will be executed next</i>.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/debugger5.png" alt="debugger5" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/debugger6.png" alt="debugger6" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
The CPU pane shows the effect of the statement that was just executed.
In the figure, MARA now has the value 0x00 and MARB has 0xFF, which is correct because 0x00FF is the content of PC.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/debugger7.png" alt="debugger7" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
Clicking Single Step two more times results in the following figure.
The third consecutive MemRead signal is set as specified by the MemRead statement in cycle 4,
and the content from the data bus is passing through MDRMux and about to be clocked into MDR.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/debugger8.png" alt="debugger8" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
Each additional click of the Single Step button executes the next cycle of the microprogram.
<p>
<h4>Stopping the debugger</h4>
If you want the program to run to completion, select Debug&rarr;Continue Debugging from the menu or click on the corresponding icon in the tool bar.
If you have inserted any break points in your program, the debugger will execute all the statements up to the statement that has a break point,
and you will still be in the debug mode.
Otherwise, the program will run to completion and exit the debug mode.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/continuedebuggingmenu.png" alt="continuedebuggingmenu" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/continuedebuggingicon.png" alt="continuedebuggingicon" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
If you want to terminate the debugging session without running the program to completion, select Debug&rarr;Stop Debugging
from the menu or click the stop sign icon in the menu bar.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/stopdebuggingmenu.png" alt="stopdebuggingmenu" hspace=10 vspace=10>

<h3><a name="Break">Break points</a></h3>

If you want to trace a program up to a specific instruction and you do not want to single step through all the previous statements to get there,
you can set a break point at the instruction and then Continue Debugging to that point.
For example, the following figure shows the program from Figure 12.5 in the textbook after Start Debugging.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/fig1205trace1.png" alt="fig1205trace1" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
The gray strip on the left of the listing is the break point area.
If you click in the break point area next to an executable statement, a red circle will appear to indicate that the statement has a break point.
In the above figure, break points have been set for cycle 4 and cycle 6.
<p>
To execute all the statements up to the next break point, select Debug&rarr;Continue Debugging from the menu or click on the corresponding icon in the tool bar.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/continuedebuggingmenu.png" alt="continuedebuggingmenu" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/continuedebuggingicon.png" alt="continuedebuggingicon" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
The following figure shows that all the statements up to but not including the one at cycle 4 have executed.
<p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/fig1205trace2.png" alt="fig1205trace2" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
The next figure shows the debugger after one more Continue Debugging operation.
The debugger executed cycles 4 and 5, and will execute cycle 6 on the next single step.
<p>

<h3><a name="Byte">Byte converter</a></h3>

Any time the Pep/9 CPU application is running, the byte converter is available in the tool bar.
The four input fields represent the value of a single byte as displayed from left to right in decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and ASCII.
Simply enter any value in any input field and the other fields will show the same value in the corresponding format.
Here is the result of entering the letter <code>P</code> in the ASCII field.
 <p>
<img src="qrc:/help-cpu/images/byteconverter.png" alt="byteconverter" hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>
An instruction specifier decoder is to the right of the four input fields.
It displays the instruction mnemonic and possibly the addressing mode assuming you interpret the byte value as an instruction specifier.
